# DSA5900_Professional_Practice

This project was used to meet the Masters of Data Science and Analytics
Professional Practice curriculum requirements at the University of Oklahoma. Specifically
the project was performed for and under the supervision of the cybersecurity company,
DTonomy. DTonomy aims to solve critical problems that security teams must deal with on a
daily basis, utilizing automation and artificial intelligence to enable smarter organization of
security alerts and incidents. The business objectives of DTonomy are to deliver meaningful insights of security
related threats and alerts to customers, reducing the level of convolution while also
providing contextual recommendations that would otherwise be difficult to obtain by an
individual or team. This project expands these insights by integrating with
G-Mail and Outlook, which have the potential to reach a larger
user base.

The objectives included software development of the email add-in applications, data analysis of a
legitimate/phishing dataset to determine important features and indicators of suspicious
emails for future application feature development, visual representation by mapping
geolocation markers of email routing paths, and implementation of recommended steps of
malicious emails.
